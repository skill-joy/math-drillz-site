    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 29, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p><strong>Skill Joy LLC</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”) publishes the <strong>Math Drillz</strong> mobile application (the “<strong>App</strong>”). This Privacy Policy explains our privacy practices for the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No collection:</strong> We do not collect, track, sell, rent, or share personal data through the App.</li>
      <li><strong>No servers:</strong> The App does not connect to or operate any servers owned or controlled by us.</li>
      <li><strong>On-device only:</strong> All App functionality runs locally on your device; App data remains on your device under your control.</li>
      <li><strong>No ads or analytics SDKs:</strong> The App contains no advertising, analytics, or social media SDKs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>None via the App.</strong> The App does not collect personal information, usage analytics, device identifiers (including IDFA), cookies, or similar tracking technologies.</p>

    <h2>4. On-Device Processing & Storage</h2>
    <p>The App processes and stores data (e.g., practice progress or settings) locally on your device. We do not transmit this data to us or to third parties. You can delete App data by uninstalling the App or using any in-App reset controls (if provided).</p>

    <h2>5. Platform-Level Diagnostics (Apple)</h2>
    <p>Apple may gather device and crash diagnostics at the operating-system level if you opt in to share analytics with app developers. If Apple makes anonymized crash information available to us, it does not identify you and we do not combine it with other information. Apple’s collection and sharing of such diagnostics are governed by Apple’s terms, privacy policy, and your device settings—not by this policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services & SDKs</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or social SDKs. We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as those terms are defined under applicable privacy laws (e.g., CCPA/CPRA).</p>

    <h2>7. Support & Voluntary Communications</h2>
    <p>If you contact us (for example via <a href="mailto:mathdrillzapp.sandbox715@passfwd.com">email</a>), we will receive the information you choose to provide (e.g., message content, screenshots, device details). We use it solely to respond and then delete it once no longer needed. If you later submit information through any web form we provide, this policy will be updated before such collection begins.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child provided personal information to us, contact us and we will delete it.</p>

    <h2>9. International Users (e.g., GDPR/UK GDPR)</h2>
    <p>We do not process personal data via the App. If you email us, we process your message only to respond (our legitimate interest). You may request deletion of your correspondence by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>10. California Privacy (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personal information via the App; we do not sell or share personal information; and we do not collect sensitive personal information via the App. If you email us, you may request access to and deletion of the content you provided.</p>

    <h2>11. Security</h2>
    <p>Because App data remains on your device, you control its security (e.g., device passcode, Face/Touch ID, encrypted backups). Keep your device software current and protect access to your device and backups.</p>

    <h2>12. Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not retain App-collected personal information (there is none). Any support emails are retained only as long as necessary to address your request and are then deleted.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If future App versions introduce network features or data collection, we will update this policy and our App Store privacy disclosures before release. Material changes will be reflected here with a new effective date.</p>

    <h2>14. Contact</h2>
    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:mathdrillzapp.sandbox715@passfwd.com">mathdrillzapp.sandbox715@passfwd.com</a><br>Skill Joy LLC — Colorado, USA</p>

    <h2>15. Legal Notices & Disclaimers</h2>
    <p><strong>No Warranties.</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
    <p><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SKILL JOY LLC BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE APP OR THIS POLICY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP (IF ANY), OR (B) USD $10.</p>
    <p><strong>Consumer Rights.</strong> Nothing in this policy is intended to limit rights you may have under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers or limitations; in those jurisdictions, such disclaimers or limitations apply only to the extent permitted by law.</p>
